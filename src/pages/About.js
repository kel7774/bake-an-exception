                    <p>Hi! My name is Kristina, &amp; I believe that everyone should enjoy desserts.</p>
                    <em>No exceptions.</em>
                    <p>When I was growing up, my mom made desserts that were so good, I had to learn how to make them myself.</p>
                    <p>What started off as a hobby of mine became a passion for all things sugar.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward to 2021, &amp; I started to get requests from friends and family to make everything from birthday cakes, smash cakes, &amp; most recently, weddings cakes.</p>
                    <p>With some encouragement from my boyfriend &amp; best friend, Derek, friends, and family, I opened up for business.</p>

                    <p>He loves playing bass, Magic, various video games, and cooking. That man can <em>cook</em> y'all.</p>
