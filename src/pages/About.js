                    <em><span>No exceptions.</span></em>
                    <p><span>When I was growing up, my mom made desserts that were so good, I had to learn how to make them myself.</span></p>
                    <p><span>What started off as a hobby of mine became a passion for all things sugar.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Fast forward to 2021, &amp; I started to get requests from friends and family to make everything from birthday cakes, smash cakes, &amp; most recently, weddings cakes.</span></p>
                    <p><span>With some encouragement from my boyfriend &amp; best friend, Derek, friends, and family, I opened up for business.</span></p>
